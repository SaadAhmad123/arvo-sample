# Terraform Backend Configuration for AWS

This Terraform configuration establishes a secure, scalable backend infrastructure for managing Terraform state files across multiple environments (development, non-production, and production) using AWS S3 and DynamoDB.

## Core Functionality

The configuration creates an S3 bucket with environment-specific folders to store Terraform state files, implementing crucial security measures and state locking mechanisms. This setup ensures safe concurrent access and state file version control across team members.

## Key Components

The infrastructure consists of several interconnected AWS resources. The S3 bucket serves as the primary storage for Terraform state files, with built-in versioning and server-side encryption. A DynamoDB table handles state locking to prevent concurrent modifications that could corrupt the state.

## Security Implementation

Security is implemented through multiple layers. The S3 bucket is configured with comprehensive public access blocks, preventing any unauthorized external access. Server-side encryption using AES-256 is enabled by default for all objects stored in the bucket. The configuration enforces these security measures as non-negotiable requirements.

## Environment Management

The configuration supports three distinct environments: `development (dev)`, `non-production (np)`, and `production (prod)`. Each environment gets its own dedicated pseudo-folder within the S3 bucket, enabling clean separation of state files across different deployment stages.

## State Management Features

Version control is implemented through S3 bucket versioning, allowing for state file history tracking and potential rollbacks if needed. The `prevent_destroy` lifecycle rule protects against accidental deletion of the state bucket, adding an extra layer of safety for critical infrastructure components.

## Required Variables

The configuration requires several essential variables for proper operation: `PROJECT_NAME` for resource grouping, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` for authentication, and `AWS_REGION` for specifying the deployment region. These should be defined in a `terraform.tfvars` file, with a sample provided in `terraform.tfvars.sample`.

## Usage Instructions

To use this configuration, developers should copy `terraform.tfvars.sample` to `terraform.tfvars` and populate it with appropriate values for their environment. The configuration will create the necessary infrastructure when applied, establishing a robust backend for managing Terraform state across multiple environments.

## Technical Considerations

The DynamoDB table uses on-demand capacity (PAY_PER_REQUEST) to automatically scale with usage patterns. The table schema is optimized for Terraform's locking mechanism, using LockID as the hash key. This setup ensures efficient operation without manual capacity management.

This configuration forms the foundation for maintaining Terraform state in a team environment, providing the necessary infrastructure for safe and efficient Infrastructure as Code practices.
