/**
 * Test-specific TypeScript configuration that enables type checking and IDE support
 * for test files while preventing them from being emitted during compilation.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - Extends base tsconfig for consistent settings
 * - Sets noEmit to prevent test files from being compiled
 * - Includes both test files and source files for proper type resolution
 * - Enables IDE features like IntelliSense and type checking
 *
 * This separate config is needed because TypeScript requires explicit test file
 * inclusion for type checking while still excluding them from builds.
