- The `packages.json` contains `require` in the default `.` export. This is because this module is being used directly by the `tailwind.config.ts` in the apps and that requires the module to emit exports as the `cjs` format. This is because the tailwind.config.ts is being directly used by the webpack bundler and the postcss and it creates a lot of module resolution issues. This was the cleanest way to approach this.
